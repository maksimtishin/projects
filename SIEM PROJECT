1. Download the Ubuntu iso and install it in a VM.

If copying from your computer to your VM doesn't work, then use the following commands in the terminal:

sudo apt install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop

Then reboot.

2. Install the curl command:

sudo apt install curl

3. (Go to the Wazuah website for further information)
Input these commands:

sudo bash

curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.13/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a

4. After installation is complete, you'll get a username and password to use. Find your VM's IP address by running (ip a), then go to the Firefox browser and paste it in to see the login screen.

Log in with the provided credentials, then press "Deploy new agent."

5. Now follow the guide and pick whatever machine you'll want to feed data from.

I chose Linux (DEB amd64)

The server address is your VM IP, which is running Wazuah. 
(Can remember the server address for ease of use)

Assign agent name.

6. Create another Ubuntu VM, into which we will copy and paste the curl command into which will install the agent. (Install the copy-paste tools again)

Run "sudo bash" to become root on the other VM, and paste the curl command to download the agent.

wget https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/pool/main/w/wazuh-agent/wazuh-agent_4.13.1-1_amd64.deb && sudo WAZUH_MANAGER='192.168.202.134' WAZUH_AGENT_NAME='UbuntuUser' dpkg -i ./wazuh-agent_4.13.1-1_amd64.deb

To start the agent, paste the next curl command into the terminal.

sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable wazuh-agent sudo systemctl start wazuh-agentsudo systemctl daemon-reloadsudo systemctl enable wazuh-agentsudo systemctl start wazuh-agent

sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
sudo systemctl enable wazuh-agent 
sudo systemctl start wazuh-agent

7. Go back to home page and the agent should show as active. Click (active) and then you'll see more info about agent.

Now you can see vulnerabilities, what the agent is doing, and lots of informaiton which is useful for keeping a device secure.

Go ahead and go back to the agent and run some commands. Then go back to the server and you'll see everything being logged.

8. Deploying a Windows agent. Same steps as before install another Windows VM and follow the installation guide.
