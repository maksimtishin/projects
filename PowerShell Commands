When using PowerShell, the commands are referred to as commandlets. You are able to use aliases instead of typing out the full commandlet. This saves time and is easier to remember since they are shorter and resemble Linux commands.

Below is a list of all the useful commands.

ipconfig /all - all networking info
ipconfig /release - let go of current IP
